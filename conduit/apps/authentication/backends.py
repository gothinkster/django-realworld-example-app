        The `authenticate` method is called on every request, regardless of
        whether the endpoint requires authentication.

        `authenticate` has two possible return values:

        1) `None` - We return `None` if we do not wish to authenticate. Usually
        this means we know authentication will fail. An example of
        this is when the request does not include a token in the
        headers.

        2) `(user, token)` - We return a user/token combination when
        authentication was successful.

        If neither of these two cases were met, that means there was an error.
        In the event of an error, we do not return anything. We simple raise
        the `AuthenticationFailed` exception and let Django REST Framework
        handle the rest.
